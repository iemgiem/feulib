# FEU Library — Lost & Found Management System

A web-based system for FEU library staff and students to report lost items, log found items, review AI-assisted matches, and manage the full release workflow.

---

## Features

- **Lost report submission** — students/faculty file reports with photos, description, and last-seen location.
- **Found item logging** — library staff log found items with category, color, storage bin, and photos.
- **Automated matching** — a weighted scoring algorithm compares found items against all open lost reports and surfaces candidates above a configurable threshold.
- **Match review** — staff approve, reject, or request more info. Approval automatically creates a claim ticket and notifies the reporter.
- **Claim workflow** — claimants upload a government/school ID; staff verify and record the physical release with a signature and selfie.
- **Expiry job** — a scheduled CLI script (`db/expire_items.php`) marks unclaimed items past the holding period as expired and rejects their pending matches.
- **Audit log** — every state-changing action is appended to `audit_logs` with actor, timestamp, IP address, and a field-level diff.
- **Role-based access** — three roles (user / staff / admin) enforced at the routing layer.
- **Live notification bell** — a JS polling endpoint keeps the unread badge current without page reloads.
- **ITS integration** — pulls the authoritative student/staff/faculty roster from FEU's Integrated Tertiary System (or the bundled mock endpoint) into a local `its_users` cache; admins can trigger a sync from the UI and a nightly CLI script runs unattended.
- **Admin reports + CSV export** — admins generate Operational Summary / Match Effectiveness / User Activity reports for any date range, preview on-screen, and export to UTF-8 BOM CSV.

## Roles

| Role | Who | What they can do |
|------|-----|-----------------|
| **user** | Students and faculty | File lost reports, track claims, manage profile |
| **staff** | Library staff | Log found items, review matches, process releases |
| **admin** | Library manager | Everything above + settings, reports, audit log, user management |

---

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1+
- MySQL 8.0+ or MariaDB 10.4+ (ships with XAMPP for Windows)
- Apache with `mod_rewrite` (XAMPP default)

---

## Local setup

### 1. Clone / copy files

Place the project folder under your XAMPP `htdocs/` directory, e.g. `C:\xampp\htdocs\feulib`.

### 2. Create the database

Open phpMyAdmin (`http://localhost/phpmyadmin`) and run:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE lfms
  CHARACTER SET utf8mb4
  COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

### 3. Import schema and seed

In phpMyAdmin → select `lfms` → **Import** → choose `db/schema.sql` → **Go**.  
Repeat for `db/seed.sql` (demo data; skip on a clean production install).

### 4. Create `config.php`

```sh
cp config.example.php config.php
```

Edit `config.php` to match your environment. The XAMPP defaults already work if you created the `lfms` database under the default `root` account. Key settings:

```php
'app' => [
    'base_url'  => 'http://localhost/feulib',
    'base_path' => '/feulib',
    'timezone'  => 'Asia/Manila',
],
'db' => [
    'host' => '127.0.0.1',
    'name' => 'lfms',
    'user' => 'root',
    'pass' => '',
],
'upload' => [
    'max_bytes'     => 4 * 1024 * 1024,   // 4 MB
    'allowed_mimes' => ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp'],
    'storage_path'  => __DIR__ . '/assets/uploads',
],
```

`config.php` holds real secrets — **never commit it**. It is listed in `.gitignore`.

### 5. Verify

Open `http://localhost/feulib` in a browser. You should reach the login page. Log in with any [demo account](#demo-accounts).

---

## Demo accounts

All seed accounts share the password **`password123`**.

| Email | Role |
|-------|------|
| `admin@feu.edu.ph` | Admin |
| `alice.reyes@feu.edu.ph` | Staff |
| `bob.santos@feu.edu.ph` | Staff |
| `juan.delacruz@feu.edu.ph` | User (student) |
| `maria.santos@feu.edu.ph` | User (student) |
| `pedro.gomez@feu.edu.ph` | User (student) |
| `ana.lopez@feu.edu.ph` | User (student) |
| `luis.tan@feu.edu.ph` | User (faculty) |

Rotate the seed password before any non-local deployment:

```sh
php db/hash_passwords.php "your-new-password"
# Copy the printed hash into seed.sql or UPDATE accounts directly.
```

## Architecture

All HTTP requests hit `index.php`. It:

1. Resolves `?p=<token>` from the query string.
2. Looks up the token in `lib/routes.php` (any unlisted token → 404).
3. Enforces authentication and the required role.
4. Includes the matching `pages/<file>.php`.

Page files are not web-accessible directly. `config.php`, `lib/`, `db/`, and `partials/` live outside any rewrite rule that would serve them publicly. `assets/uploads/` is protected by a Deny-from-all `.htaccess`; uploaded files are served only through `serve_upload.php` which enforces per-attachment ownership checks.

---

## Expiry job

```sh
# Preview what would be expired (no writes):
php db/expire_items.php --dry

# Run normally:
php db/expire_items.php
```

Schedule via Windows Task Scheduler at noon, Mon–Sat — see `db/expire_items.php` for the `schtasks` command. The holding period (default: 365 days) is configurable from **Admin → Settings**.

---

## ITS integration

The system can pull a roster of authoritative student / staff / faculty records from FEU's Integrated Tertiary System (ITS) and cache them locally in `its_users`. The cache feeds the admin directory page (`?p=admin.its`) and is the source of identity used for ID verification at release time.

Configure the endpoint, auth mode, and credentials under the `its` key in `config.php` (see `config.example.php`). A bundled mock — `?p=api.its_mock` — serves a static JSON payload for local development; point `its.endpoints.*` at it when working without a real ITS server.

```sh
# One-time manual sync (admin UI button does the same thing):
php db/sync_its.php

# Schedule nightly at 02:00:
schtasks /Create /SC DAILY /TN "LFMS Sync ITS" /TR "php C:\xampp\htdocs\feulib\db\sync_its.php" /ST 02:00
```

The local `its_users` table is populated by the first sync. If you imported `db/schema.sql` from scratch the table already exists; if you upgraded an older database, apply `db/migrations/2026_its_users.sql` first.

---

## Tuning the matching algorithm

```sh
php db/match_debug.php
```

Prints a per-pair scoring breakdown (category, color, location, date,
description) for every lost × found report currently in the database,
plus the configured weights and threshold. Read-only — useful for sanity
checking after changing weights under **Admin → Settings → Match
Scoring**. Not a test runner: there are no assertions, so the exit code
is always `0` unless PHP itself blows up.

## Development notes

See `DEVELOPMENT.md` for conventions on adding pages, using the DB helpers, audit logging, and the CSRF / flash / redirect patterns.
